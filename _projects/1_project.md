Completed this project in collaboration with Bosch, as part of their prestigious PRIXEL program. Our team had developed a highly effective real-time pothole and speed breaker detection system using advanced object detection models.

Through this innovative technology, our system accurately identifies potential hazards on the road, enabling drivers to avoid them and reducing the risk of accidents caused by potholes and speed breakers. Our model is highly accurate and efficient, ensuring that even the smallest obstacles are detected with precision.

My team was proud to have contributed to the field of road safety with this groundbreaking project. With Bosch's support and our team's expertise, we've created a solution that has the potential to make a real difference in the lives of drivers.

<!-- Every project has a beautiful feature showcase page.
It's easy to include images in a flexible 3-column grid format.
Make your photos 1/3, 2/3, or full width.

To give your project a background in the portfolio page, just add the img tag to the front matter like so: -->

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/res1.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    A marked speed breaker being detected by our model.
</div>

<!-- You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images. -->

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/res2.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
